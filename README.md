Plain JS Material Time Picker

This is a proof of concept that I created based on the material analog time picker. It uses no external libraries or scripts and is entirely self contained. I originally created it so I could use the Material Design spec without using the Angular library.

For convenience, I have added a dev dependency of http-server. To use, simply do an `npm install` then run `npx http-server ./`. After navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8080, you should be able to see the component in action.

Enjoy!
